# Clear Shaders

As the name implies, it clears the DCS shader folders.

# Kill DCS

Kills all DCS.exe and SR-ClientRadio.exe processes.

I use this to clean up my workstation at the end of a session, or between game restarts so that SR-ClientRadio.exe is once again a child process of DCS.exe (for Discord audio screensharing).

**This script may need to be run as admin if you have "Require Admin" enabled in SRS. You can set the properties of the shortcut file to run as admin to help with this.**

# Kill DCS (All)

Kills all DCS related processes, including support programs like TrackIR5, VoiceAttack and SimAppPro. -- Must be run as admin!

I use this one aft**er every play s**ession so my workstation doesn't stay on all night. Apparently TrackIR5.exe sometimes inhibits system sleep.

**This script may need to be run as admin to close SRS (see above) and SimAppPro. You can set the properties of the shortcut file to run as admin to help with this.**

# Set DCS to high priority

Sets the DCS.exe process to high priority for better performance.
