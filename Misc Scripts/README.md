# Clear Shaders

As the name implies, it clears the DCS shader folders.

# Kill DCS

Kills all DCS.exe and SR-ClientRadio.exe processes.

I use this to clean up my workstation at the end of a session, or between game restarts so that SR-ClientRadio.exe is once again a child process of DCS.exe (for Discord audio screensharing).

# Kill DCS (All)

Kills all DCS related processes, including support programs like TrackIR5, VoiceAttack and SimAppPro. -- Must be run as admin!

I use this one after every play session so my workstation doesn't stay on all night. Apparently TrackIR5.exe sometimes inhibits system sleep.

# Set DCS to high priority

Sets the DCS.exe process to high priority for better performance.
