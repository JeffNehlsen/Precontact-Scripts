# Kill Stuck Windows

Kill process windows that contain specific text strings. Useful for killing stuck server instances that got held up with "Can't run" or "Login Failed".

## Usage

Run 'Kill Stuck Windows.bat' in a terminal window, or double click the file.  
Ideally create a scheduled task to run this interactively on the desktop every X minutes.

An example task may be found alongside the script in the project folder.
