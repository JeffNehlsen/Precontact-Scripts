# VoiceAttack

Custom VoiceAttack profile for Return Pre-Contact.

Before using the profile, you need to define which key the 'CTLD' menu is. To do this, say "Set Key". VoiceAttack will respond with "Set Key" to confirm that it is listening. Open your radio menu and go to "F10. Other" and state which key the CTLD menu is assigned to. If the CTLD menu is displayed as "F6. CTLD" you would say "F SIX". The bot will then respond with "F6" to confirm that it has been set properly.
